## :pushpin: Info.

Hola! My name is Jaime Santos Rodríguez, I'm a Margarita Salas Fellow at the [Universidad Autónoma de Madrid](http://verso.mat.uam.es/web/index.php/es/inicio) and at [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/mathematical-sciences/). 

Previously I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [MPIM](https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/), my mentor there was  [Prof. Dr. K.-T. Sturm](https://wt.iam.uni-bonn.de/sturm/home).
I did Ph.D. at the [Universidad Autónoma de Madrid](http://verso.mat.uam.es/web/index.php/es/inicio) and I was a member
of the [ICMAT](http://www.icmat.es). My adviser was [Prof. Luis Guijarro](http://www.uam.es/personal_pdi/ciencias/lguijarr/index-esp.html).

## :computer: Research.

I’m particularly interested in metric measure spaces that admit generalizations of lower curvature bounds (Sectional and Ricci). These spaces appear   naturally as Gromov-Hausdorff limits of manifolds. My research focuses on their isometry groups and the effect of isometric Lie group actions on these spaces.
